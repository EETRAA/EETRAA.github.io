										<h1>My way to learn a language</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/national_flags_low_perspective.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is not a magic article that allow you to learn a gimmick on mastering a certain language in one month. But all the opinions in this article were tested by myself and I find it quite practical.</p>
									
									<h2>Before we get started, let's go through these two questions first.</h2>
									<div class = "row">
										<div class = "col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>How far do you wanna go?</h3>
											<p>First of all, I'm not a doctor or an expert either. But it indeed works for me. Hopefully, it will work for you. <br />How do you define a person finally masters a second language? My answer is: when you feel like it was your first language. Frankly, this is as far as I wanna go. A little crazy, huh? I'll do it whatsoever.</p>
										</div>
										<div class = "col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Is this suitable for me?</h3>
											<p>Don't worry, my friends. It's all about concept and method. Everyone can find something here, wherever level you at on English learning. Learning a language is kind of like dating your lover, pantince and grace are highly required. </p>
										</div>
									
									</div>
									
									<hr class = "major" />
									
									<h2>No gimmicks, let's go! &#x1F919;&#x1F43B;&#x1F919;</h2>
									
									<!--
									<div style = "-moz-transform:scaleX(-1);"></div>
									-->
									
									<div class = "row gtr-200">
										<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>The voice in you mind.</h3>
											<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">
												<span class = "image fit">
													<img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
											<p>What for lunch? Why this plain looking car so expensive? Should I marry her? What's the password again?
											There is a voice in our brain always covering everything for us&#x1F47B;. But, for most of us, it seems that this person speaks the same language with us. Coincidence? 
											Before we get started, let's name this person Mr./Mrs. languager. And here we go!
											If you wanna learn a new language, considering this: let your Mr./Mrs. languager bend the rules and speak this new language.
											Seems freaking unfriendly for green hand? Well, challenge can be a cool thing, right?
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Use this language to feel the language.</h3>
											<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">
												<span class = "image fit">
													<img src="images/desert.jpg" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>			
											<p>When you see an image of desert, you feel the burning in your throat, remind you of a certain experience that you never wanna mention in your whole life. When you see a snapshot of forest fire, you feel suffocated and depressed through the blur motion of the image of a living human tragedy. You see, the feelings we have indeed inspire our imagination. So put our imagination to use is really helpful.
											Have you ever cuddled your beloved one?(I haven't, &#x1F62D;&#x1F631;just noticed.) Have you ever left your keys at home? It did happened, cause we're all human living on the earth. Which lead us to this point: learn a new language is by no means do some research on alien activities. Don't be afraid, it's just another way to see, describe and feel the world. Also don't look up a new word in the dictionary, you should guess its meaning from the context, google it in the google image section is also a smart and helpful choice.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Vocabulary, phrases, slang.</h3>
											<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">
												<span class = "image fit">
													<img src="images/adventure.jpg" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>										
											<p>
											&#x2699;&#xFE0F;First stage, words. It's feels more like a curiosity required work. Learning a specific field of English words not only expend the vocabulary itself, but also bring us to a new world. Sometimes it can be the opportunity for you to get promoted.<br />
											&#x1F517;Next stage, phrases. A combination of some simple words will totally change these plain words. It can be powerful, flattering, full of aggressiveness. It complete the language.<br />
											&#x2708;&#xFE0F;Further stage, slang. I love rap songs. But it was extremely painful when I tried to figure out the lyrics. It's more like a dialect belonging only to black people. But wait, the word they use are not that much complicated than I think it would be. (thinking emoji)Well, now the "lots in, lots out" strategy can show his power! Yes, when we read a truckload of lyrics, we will get familiar with the frequently used words, like strength, strong, show, etc. 
											<br />So, study like a baby, you will get benefit from it.

											<h3>Phonetic phenomena.</h3>
											<div class = "col-6 col-12-medium">

												</span>
											</div>											
											<p>
											"Stay cheeki breeki!"&#x1F919; <br />Is that English? Well, 50/50, English is been widely used in the world, it's not a surprise that it developed many forks. No big deal. The more we deal with a certain fork, the more we get familiar with it. Just like the pronunciation, it varies form place to place. But I am not a pro at this field, so fire up your web browser, open Youtube, search for English phonetics, and some relevant videos or channels will be recommended, in this way, you could subscribe some youtubers, get your resources sorted, and finally start your learning journey.
											It should be available for most languages learning.

											<p>How could a man escape the prison successfully? &#x1F914;Cause he had a detailed plan. Have some coffee, take a break, think about your current learning method and patch it. <br />Although my second language is Englsih, these tips above should be available for most languages learning.</p>
